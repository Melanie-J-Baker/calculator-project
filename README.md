Calculator contains functions for all of the basic math operators you typically find on simple calculators: add, subtract, multiply, divide.

A basic HTML calculator with buttons for each digit, each of the above functions and an “Equals” key, and a display. Includes a “clear” button.

Users can string together several operations and get the right answer, with each pair of numbers being evaluated at a time. Calculator does not evaluate more than a single pair of numbers at a time.

Rounds answers with long decimals so that they don’t overflow the screen. Displays an error message if the user tries to divide by 0… and doesn’t crash the calculator.
